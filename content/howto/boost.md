Phoenix Finance allows users to contribute stablecoins into the options pool to earn options premiums, or relating cryptoassets into the lending pool for leveraged tokens to earn interest. In order to incentivize the contribution, Phoenix Finance provides mining rewards for the liquidity contributors in cPHX.

In addition to the basic rewards, boosted rewards are incentives for miners staking PHX or cPHX in the contracts, meaning users can stake PHX or cPHX in the boosting contracts to enhance the basic mining rewards.

Please check [the Rewarding and Boosting System](https://docs.phx.finance/mining/mining/) for more details. Here is a short, hands-on guide on how to boost the rewards.

## Step 1
First of all, you have to navigate to the [Phoenix homepage](phx.finance). Here, navigate to the “DApp” button on the top right and click on “mining”. Or you may just check on [the app UI](app.phx.finance) and navigate to the “Earn” section.
