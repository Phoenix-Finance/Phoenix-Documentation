# How to Designate Your Boosting to Other Pools

As introduced in the  [the Rewarding and Boosting System](https://docs.phx.finance/mining/mining/),  in addition to the basic rewards, boosted rewards are incentives for miners staking PHX or cPHX in the contracts, meaning users can stake PHX or cPHX in the boosting contracts to enhance the basic mining rewards.

The mining contract gives stakers greater flexibility, that users can adjust the pools they intend to boost in, even after staking.

Here is a short, hands-on guide on how to designate your boosting effects of mining to other pools.
## Step 1
Following the same steps in the [reward boosting guide](https://docs.phx.finance/howto/boost/), please navigate to the 'earn' UI and connect your wallet.
## Step 2
Choose the pool you want to move your boosting effect to. In this example, I intend to move the boosting from the Matic Pool to the USDC Pool.
